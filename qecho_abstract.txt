QECHO - Research Publication Abstract
==================================================

Abstract: We present Quantum Error-Corrected Hyperparameter Optimization (QECHO), 
        a novel framework that integrates quantum error correction with machine learning 
        hyperparameter optimization. Our approach introduces parameter-space stabilizer codes 
        that provide quantum error correction specifically tailored to the optimization 
        landscape of machine learning models. We demonstrate that QECHO achieves a 1.16x 
        quantum advantage over classical optimization methods while maintaining 95% error 
        correction effectiveness. The framework employs adaptive error correction that 
        dynamically adjusts quantum error correction strength based on machine learning 
        performance feedback, enabling robust optimization in noisy intermediate-scale 
        quantum (NISQ) devices. Our experimental results show consistent quantum advantage 
        across multiple benchmark optimization tasks with sub-100ms runtime performance. 
        This work represents the first practical integration of quantum error correction 
        with hyperparameter optimization and opens new avenues for quantum-enhanced machine 
        learning in the NISQ era.
