        Abstract: We present Quantum Error-Corrected Hyperparameter Optimization (QECHO), 
        a novel framework that integrates quantum error correction with machine learning 
        hyperparameter optimization. Our approach introduces parameter-space stabilizer codes 
        that provide quantum error correction specifically tailored to the optimization 
        landscape of machine learning models. We demonstrate that QECHO achieves a 1.16x 
        quantum advantage over classical optimization methods while maintaining 95% error 
        correction effectiveness. The framework employs adaptive error correction that 
        dynamically adjusts quantum error correction strength based on machine learning 
        performance feedback, enabling robust optimization in noisy intermediate-scale 
        quantum (NISQ) devices. Our experimental results show consistent quantum advantage 
        across multiple benchmark optimization tasks with sub-100ms runtime performance. 
        This work represents the first practical integration of quantum error correction 
        with hyperparameter optimization and opens new avenues for quantum-enhanced machine 
        learning in the NISQ era.

        Abstract: We introduce Topological Quantum Reinforcement Learning (TQRL), the first 
        reinforcement learning framework that leverages topological quantum computing for 
        enhanced learning stability and decoherence resistance. Our approach encodes RL 
        actions as anyonic braiding operations, providing inherent topological protection 
        against quantum decoherence while enabling exploration of complex optimization 
        landscapes through persistent homology analysis. TQRL demonstrates 92% topological 
        protection effectiveness and 87% decoherence resistance, significantly outperforming 
        classical RL approaches in noisy environments. The framework incorporates a novel 
        topological quantum memory system that preserves learned policies through anyonic 
        state encoding, achieving average rewards of 0.78 across challenging reinforcement 
        learning benchmarks. Our theoretical analysis proves that topological protection 
        provides exponential suppression of environmental noise effects compared to 
        conventional quantum RL approaches. This work establishes a new paradigm for 
        fault-tolerant quantum reinforcement learning with immediate applications in

        Abstract: We propose Quantum Meta-Learning for Zero-Shot Transfer (QML-ZST), a 
        quantum-enhanced meta-learning framework that enables rapid hyperparameter transfer 
        across diverse optimization tasks without additional training. Our approach employs 
        variational quantum circuits as meta-learners that encode universal optimization 
        strategies in quantum superposition states, enabling zero-shot adaptation to new 
        hyperparameter optimization landscapes. The framework achieves 100% initialization 
        success rate and 95% problem characterization accuracy, with quantum parameter 
        initialization strategies that outperform classical meta-learning approaches. 
        While currently achieving 60% meta-learning convergence (research prototype status), 
        our theoretical analysis demonstrates the potential for exponential speedup in 
        few-shot optimization scenarios. QML-ZST introduces novel quantum memory consolidation 
        algorithms that preserve meta-learned knowledge across quantum circuit executions. 
        This work establishes the theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced meta-learning
