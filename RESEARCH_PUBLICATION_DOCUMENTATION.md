## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations

### Quantum Coherence Echo Theory

**Theoretical Framework:**
The quantum coherence echo phenomenon is governed by the following Hamiltonian evolution:

```
H_echo(t) = H_0 + H_decoherence(t) + H_recoherence(t)
```

Where:
- `H_0`: Base system Hamiltonian
- `H_decoherence(t)`: Controlled decoherence operator
- `H_recoherence(t)`: Re-coherence pulse operator

**Echo Fidelity:**
```
F_echo = |⟨ψ_initial|ψ_echo⟩|² 
```

**Memory Persistence:**
```
P_memory(t) = exp(-t/T_memory) × F_echo
```

### Quantum Meta-Learning Theory  

**Meta-Gradient in Quantum Hilbert Space:**
```
∇_θ L_meta = Σ_i ∇_θ L_i(θ + α∇_θ L_i(θ))
```

**Quantum Knowledge Transfer Bound:**
```
|P_transfer - P_optimal| ≤ ε(d_quantum(S_source, S_target))
```

Where `d_quantum` is the quantum distance between source and target problems.

### Topological Quantum Protection

**Topological Gap Protection:**
```
Δ_topo = min{E_excited - E_ground}
```

**Braiding Group Generator:**
```
σ_i = exp(iπ/5) × R_i
```

Where `R_i` is the R-matrix for Fibonacci anyons.

**Error Correction Rate:**
```
R_correction = 1 - exp(-Δ_topo/k_B T_noise)
```
