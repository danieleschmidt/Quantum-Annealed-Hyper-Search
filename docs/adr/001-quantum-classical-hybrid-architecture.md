# ADR-001: Quantum-Classical Hybrid Architecture

## Status
accepted

## Context
We need to design an optimization framework that can leverage quantum computing advantages while maintaining compatibility with classical optimization methods. The challenge is to create a unified architecture that can:

1. Automatically select the most appropriate algorithm (quantum vs classical) based on problem characteristics
2. Provide seamless fallback mechanisms when quantum hardware is unavailable
3. Enable hybrid approaches that combine both quantum and classical techniques
4. Scale from small research problems to enterprise-scale optimization tasks

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid quantum-classical architecture with the following key components:

1. **Backend Abstraction Layer**: A unified interface that abstracts quantum and classical backends, allowing transparent switching between different optimization approaches.

2. **Problem Analyzer**: An intelligent component that analyzes optimization problems and recommends the most suitable algorithm based on:
   - Problem size and complexity
   - Available computational resources
   - Hardware availability (quantum vs classical)
   - Performance requirements and constraints

3. **Hybrid Optimization Engine**: A core engine capable of:
   - Running pure quantum algorithms for suitable problems
   - Using classical algorithms for rapid prototyping and small problems
   - Implementing hybrid quantum-classical approaches for maximum effectiveness
   - Automatic fallback to classical methods when quantum hardware is unavailable

4. **Multi-Scale Architecture**: Support for different optimization scales:
   - Local optimization for parameter fine-tuning
   - Regional optimization for algorithm selection
   - Global optimization for comprehensive hyperparameter search

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Flexibility**: Users can leverage quantum advantages when available while maintaining classical compatibility
- **Reliability**: Automatic fallback ensures system availability even when quantum hardware is down
- **Performance**: Intelligent algorithm selection optimizes performance for each specific problem
- **Future-Proof**: Architecture can adapt to emerging quantum hardware and algorithms
- **Accessibility**: Researchers and enterprises can use the same framework regardless of quantum hardware access

### Challenges and Risks
- **Complexity**: Increased architectural complexity requires careful design and testing
- **Performance Overhead**: Algorithm selection and abstraction layers may introduce latency
- **Resource Management**: Need sophisticated resource allocation between quantum and classical compute
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting issues across hybrid execution paths can be complex
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing requires access to both quantum and classical environments

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging across all execution paths
- Design performance benchmarks for algorithm selection validation
- Create robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Establish clear debugging and troubleshooting procedures
- Implement automated testing with quantum simulators when hardware is unavailable

## Notes
This decision aligns with the current quantum computing landscape where:
- Quantum hardware has limited availability and noise characteristics
- Classical optimization methods remain highly effective for many problems
- Hybrid approaches often provide the best practical performance
- The field is rapidly evolving with new quantum algorithms and hardware

The architecture will be evaluated and potentially revised as quantum computing technology matures and becomes more widely available.
