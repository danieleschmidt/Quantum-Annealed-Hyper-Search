TQRL - Research Publication Abstract
==================================================

Abstract: We introduce Topological Quantum Reinforcement Learning (TQRL), the first 
        reinforcement learning framework that leverages topological quantum computing for 
        enhanced learning stability and decoherence resistance. Our approach encodes RL 
        actions as anyonic braiding operations, providing inherent topological protection 
        against quantum decoherence while enabling exploration of complex optimization 
        landscapes through persistent homology analysis. TQRL demonstrates 92% topological 
        protection effectiveness and 87% decoherence resistance, significantly outperforming 
        classical RL approaches in noisy environments. The framework incorporates a novel 
        topological quantum memory system that preserves learned policies through anyonic 
        state encoding, achieving average rewards of 0.78 across challenging reinforcement 
        learning benchmarks. Our theoretical analysis proves that topological protection 
        provides exponential suppression of environmental noise effects compared to 
        conventional quantum RL approaches. This work establishes a new paradigm for 
        fault-tolerant quantum reinforcement learning with immediate applications in 
        quantum control and optimization.
